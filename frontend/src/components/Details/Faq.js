                                    We are quite flexible with book borrowing. Typically, we allow our users to borrow a book for 14 days. However, if you do not return it by the due date, the book gets auto renewed for another 12 days. Though, a book can only be auto-renewed once, after which, the late fees would be levied.

                                    This is pretty straightforward! You can just search the book you are interested in borrowing, add it to the cart, and follow the checkout procedure. Once our team confirms, you'll receive a notification for the same.  You can then pick it up from your nearest library having a partnership with our application at your convenience.
